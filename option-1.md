# Brewery Tours

Your job, as a team, is to build a new version of [Brewery Tours](https://github.com/boolean-uk/boolean-uk-react-brewery-tours) with a custom backend API!

The application looks outdated and isn't very user friendly, so you're tasked with building a completely new version from the ground up.

The new app should contain all of the same features as the original and have a modern user interface. We don't want to rely on a 3rd party API so you'll have to design a custom database, populate it with data and build an API for it.

Additionally, we want our users to be able to create accounts so they can log in and save breweries as favourites so they can easily find them later.

Users should also be able to book a tour of a brewery by submitting a form. They should have the ability to view a list of their own tour bookings, cancel them and edit them.

We'd like an admin section to the app which allows admin users to see and modify everything. They should be able to remove users, add and remove breweries, and change or cancel tours that have been booked for any brewery.
