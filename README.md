# Fullstack Team Project

## Learning Objectives

- Use agile ceremonies including stand-ups, retrospectives, sprint planning and stakeholder demos to develop software as a team
- Design and build a full-stack architecture that has a frontend application consuming data from a backend API
- Use a source code management tool to integrate work in one codebase with multiple contributors

## Project Requirements

- Must be a full-stack application with a ReactJS frontend consuming data from a database-backend API
- Must not expose sensitive information
- Must not contain hard coded URL’s (routes are fine, `http://localhost` is not)
- Commit messages must be consistent and meaningful
    - Keep them in present tense (✅ `add, remove, update` ❌ `added, removed, updated`)
    - Keep them short and descriptive ( `change hashing library`, `add password to user model` )
    - [Here are some good guidelines](https://reflectoring.io/meaningful-commit-messages/) but don’t go overboard, the above two bullet points are enough

## Assessment

- Students will work on feature branches and create pull requests to merge in to the `main` branch upon teacher approval. The team must discuss and provide feedback on the implementation in the PR before a teacher provides their feedback and final approval. [See pull-requests.md for the process.](./pull-requests.md)
- Stakeholder demo’s at the end of each sprint (3 days)
- End of project retrospectives
- End of project survey to collect feedback
