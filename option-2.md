# Pokémon Forum

Your job, as a team, is to build a Pokémon forum with a custom backend API!

Your client wants to create a discussion forum where users are able to rank the original 151 generation 1 Pokémon.

The new app should have a modern user interface. The client doesn't want to rely on a 3rd party API so you'll have to design a custom database, populate it with data and build an API for it.

The client wants their users to be able to create accounts so they can log in and discuss and rank each of the Pokémon.
Additionally, users should have the ability to view a list of their own discussions and rankings, including the ability to cancel and edit them.

Your client would also like an admin section to the app which allows admin users to moderate any of the discussions; after all, ranking Pokémon can get lively! Those admins should be able to remove users (for bad behaviour).

There are API's out there that can give you a ton of data on Pokémon, such as https://pokeapi.co. Feel free to use these to help construct your database but your app must not rely on these 3rd party API's in any way.
